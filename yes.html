			<h2>I love you, Johanna. Thank you for being there with me although you would be messed up sometimes, I still will love you. Also, Happy birthday and Happy monthsary to the both of us -w- I'm glad i had met you, the first time we met was really unpredictable. If we hadn't met, I'm sure you would've been rebellious by now :C and probably falling for some play boys. Babe, I know I'm not all that type of a guy like I'm not all perfect, but i tried to be. I just hope that i became a great bf you could ever have.. It's not much but i spent hours for this qwq</h2>
